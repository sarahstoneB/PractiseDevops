Method 1:  Using apt repository to install aws cli in Ubuntu.
First of all we will install from official repository of Ubuntu. Check the Ubuntu version first and then update official repository of Ubuntu.

    cat /etc/lsb-release
    apt-get update
Now we are going to install aws cli, kindly run below command and follow the step.
    apt-get install awscli
    aws --version
Method 2: Installing with Python Pip.
We have successfully installed aws cli but when I have checked this is showing old version let’s upgrade to new version with the help of pip. Use the curl command to download the installation scripts.
    curl -O https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py         
When our scripts will download then we will execute this script with the help of python follow below step.
    python3 get-pip.py --user
when you have installed pip than you have to add it’s variable by default it’s not installed.
    export PATH=~/.local/bin:$PATH
    source ~/.profile      
Now install aws cli from pip.
    pip3 install awscli --upgrade --user 
    aws --version

Now You have successfully upgraded your aws old version to new version but still you didn’t add your AWS access key and security key file from aws gui console to aws cli. Without adding access key and security key you can not access your aws cli. Let’s do it.

cat .aws/config
cat .aws/credentials
